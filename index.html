    <p> The topic for my video is about stress. Under stress conditions, we all want to release our emotions in various ways. For example, there is a scene in a video, which is about the rocks were being dropped to a glass of water. The glass represents our body and mind, while the rocks are the stressors. One rock would not cause any different, however, if we hold all of the rocks together, our mind would be explode at one point.  The scene of a broken glass was shown in order to illustrate this idea. Furthermore, while under stress, we always look at everything in depressing ways. For instance, many scenes in the video explain this idea, such as scratching the paper, depressing guitar sound, etc. Also, intense music and bright color backgrounds were utilized to enhance the negative emotions of the audiences. </p>

       <p> To me, the purpose experimental documentary video is to bring audiences back to the past. With that point of view, I chose black and white video as my method to achieve this purpose. The colors of the video represent my uncle's stream of memories. It is like a flashback to himself as well as to me. The second reason, which makes black and white video become the perfect fit for my video, is to magnify the sadness of my uncle's past. Along with the colors, slow music also utilized to enhance the sadness and stresses of my uncle. Furthermore, the second function of the music is to unite the emotions of my uncles and audiences into one. Then,  at the end of the video, strong and fast music, and colorful images are used to illustrate the present time. They are signals for the audiences to understand that my uncle's life is better now. They also link the past and the present together in my video. And, my messages can be highlighted through these colorful details: Challenging life will make you a strong person and your life will be colorful at the end. <p>
