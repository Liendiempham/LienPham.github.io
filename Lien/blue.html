<p>Spicy Nacho Doritos are my families go to chips. They aren't very spicy at all but they have a wonderful flavor that is different from any other chip I have had.This is definitely a type of chip that you need to pour out onto a napkin because if you don't you will look down and realize that you have eaten the whole bag by yourself.
